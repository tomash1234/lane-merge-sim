# Lane Merging Simulator  

A simple 3D lane-merging simulator. After a few near-death experiences while teaching my wife how to merge onto a
motorway, I decided to create this simulator to help her practice safely. It simulates real-world car acceleration 
and braking using realistic parameters.

## 🕹️ Controls  

- **W / S / A / D** - Car movement (W = accelerate, S = brake, A = steer left, D = steer right)  
- **P** - Pause / resume  
- **R** - Restart  

## 🏁 Levels  

- Currently, there are **10 levels**.  
- To advance to the next level, you must successfully merge **three times in a row**.  
- If you crash, your streak counter resets.
